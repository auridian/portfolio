What happens when you take a Razor E100 electric scooter, rip out everything but the red metal frame and the front wheel, and fill it with much higher-quality components?

You get this!

*The scooter in all its glory.*

Battery stats: 36 A123 LiFePo4 cells (FS300001) in a 12S3P configuration, the maximum amount of cells you could feasibly put into the old battery compartment. The old setup had a 24 V lead-acid setup; this one I charge up to about 43 V.

*The hand-soldered battery pack.*

I replaced the 100 W kick-start only DC motor with a Turnigy SK8 6374-130KV sensored BLDC motor running at about 1.8 kW.

My top speed is now a little over 20 mph; the stock configuration is 10 mph.

The throttle is now a continuous thumb-throttle, rather than an on/off twist-switch.

The ignition is a classy key-switch installed in the right handlebar.

The charger is a little less classy, but amusing nonetheless:

*Thankfully, nothing burned down from using this charger.*

This is a terrifying butchering of a 90W Dell laptop power supply fed into a generic boost converter I found on Amazon that has nice current and voltage setting for CC/CV. The leads from the (20 V) laptop supply are also fed in parallel to a tiny cheap buck converter to step down to 7 V to power a fan because it turns out that the tiny passive heatsink that the boost converter came with is not nearly enough to handle the heat generated by the converter. A XT60 connector completes the charging apparatus and connects directly to the battery pack leads.

As of Spring 2021, the battery pack of this scooter has fallen into disrepair (I need to rebalance and recharge, assuming no cells have died -- I will have more time over summer 2021 to do this, hopefully.
