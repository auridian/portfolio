I am a mechanical engineering graduate of MIT (class of 2021). My focus was on electromechanical systems applied to the biological domain.

Ultimately, I seek to enhance the lived human experience through technological interventions, employing whatever domains of knowledge are necessary to do so, and continually expanding my knowledge in order to better do so. This often takes the form of medical devices, but I am interested in branching into augmentative technologies, adding capabilities to the human body rather than merely restoring it to a "normal" state. 
 
From February 2020 to June 2021 (I had to resign upon graduation), I was the president of W1XM, the MIT UHF Repeater Association (the sister club to the MIT Radio Society, W1MX). I'm an extra class radio amateur known as AI1XR. See the projects blog for a discussion about various activities I've been involved with in the MIT Radio Society.
