		<p>
			My senior capstone unfortunately coincided with the fully virtualized semester of Fall 2020. Nevertheless, I was able to have a meaningful team-based project experience working on an oxygen generation system
			and distribution concept in MIT's 2.75 capstone, Medical Device Design.

      <p>		Battery stats: 36 A123 LiFePo<sub>4</sub> cells (FS300001) in a 12S3P configuration, the maximum amount of cells you could feasibly put into the old battery compartment. The old setup had a 24 V lead-acid setup; this one I charge up to about 43 V.

		I replaced the 100 W kick-start only DC motor with a Turnigy SK8 6374-130KV sensored BLDC motor running at about 1.8 kW.
		</p><p>
		My top speed is now a little over 20 mph; the stock configuration is 10 mph.
		</p><p>
		The throttle is now a continuous thumb-throttle, rather than an on/off twist-switch.
		</p><p>
		The ignition is a classy key-switch installed in the right handlebar.
		</p><p>
		The charger is a little less classy, but amusing nonetheless:

	    <p>Thankfully, nothing burned down from using this charger.</p>

	<p>This is a terrifying butchering of a 90W Dell laptop power supply fed into a generic boost converter I found on Amazon that has nice current and voltage setting for CC/CV. The leads from the (20 V) laptop supply are also fed in parallel to a tiny cheap buck converter to step down to 7 V to power a fan because it turns out that the tiny passive heatsink that the boost converter came with is not nearly enough to handle the heat generated by the converter. A XT60 connector completes the charging apparatus and connects directly to the battery pack leads.
