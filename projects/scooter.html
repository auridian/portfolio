What happens when you take a Razor E100 electric scooter, rip out everything but the red metal frame and the front wheel, and fill it with much higher-quality components?

You get this!

Battery stats: 36 A123 LiFePo<sub>4</sub> cells (FS300001) in a 12S3P configuration, the maximum amount of cells you could feasibly put into the old battery compartment. The old setup had a 24 V lead-acid setup; this one I charge up to about 43 V.

I replaced the 100 W kick-start only DC motor with a Turnigy SK8 6374-130KV sensored BLDC motor running at about 1.8 kW.

My top speed is now a little over 20 mph; the stock configuration is 10 mph.

The throttle is now a continuous thumb-throttle, rather than an on/off twist-switch.

The ignition is a classy key-switch installed in the right handlebar.

The charger is a little less classy, but amusing nonetheless:

This is a terrifying butchering of a 90W Dell laptop power supply fed into a generic boost converter I found on Amazon that has nice current and voltage setting for CC/CV. The leads from the (20 V) laptop supply are also fed in parallel to a tiny cheap buck converter to step down to 7 V to power a fan because it turns out that the tiny passive heatsink that the boost converter came with is not nearly enough to handle the heat generated by the converter. A XT60 connector completes the charging apparatus and connects directly to the battery pack leads.
